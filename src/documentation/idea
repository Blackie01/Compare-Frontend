Problem Statement: 
I know React very well, but when trying to use Angular, I have to do a lot of research to know the syntax and processes involved in implementing some logic i already know. I just want to be able to easily transfer my knowledge of using one framework to another language. 


Solution: 

CompareFrontend 

An app that compares how different frameworks/library approach the same concept or logic. 
For instance, if you're a frontend developer vast in React, but you want to implement lazyloading in Angular, the application can help your see a two-way display on how the execution of the process look like in both libraries/framework. 
The output of the application will be a two output field design that shows either framework or library on each field, with texts and codeblocks comparing the implementation of the two.
